How I find focus in a bull-run

## What are you good at?
You can't do it all. Pick what you're good at and stick to it. Ignore everything else.

Not good at anything? Pick something and start learning. The industry is full of noobs at all levels, and competence is proof of work. 

## Airdrops
There's too much to keep up with. Delegate to the airdrop hunters and schedule an hour a month to look at their best recommendations. Unless you're doing it full-time, you WILL miss out. Accept this, and try not to be mad you missed out.

## Number go up - trading
I can't trade. You probably can't either (or you wouldn't be reading this). Do what you're best at - code, docs, marketing, BD, and forget about trading. Lock up your money so you can't be tempted. 90% of my $ is staked with a 3 day lockup.

## Twitter 
Schedule time on Twitter. You'll never miss anything.

## Above all - find your purpose
Why are you here? To make money? Then pick the most sure path for making money. 

To push the world forward? Find the best way you can, stick to it. I teach. 

To find work? Don't take shortcuts, there aren't any. You're competing with the rest of the world.

To have fun? Decide what isn't fun, and **stay away from it**.
